It works faster than alternatives like LocalIAPStore because instead of hooking the purchase itself and verifying it without paying, Satella simply tells the app that the item has been purchased.\n\nYou will notice that it runs very smoothly, even capable hacking server-sided purchases that use IAPHelper.\n\nIf you can afford to do so, please support small/independent developers by not abusing Satella. Satella works excellently with Crane, allowing for it to be used as an \"evaluation period\" as well as piracy tool.\n\n**Supports arm64 and arm64e devices on iOS 13-14**",
