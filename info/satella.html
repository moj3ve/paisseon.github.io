<p>I love you. Because you gave me light. Because you took my hand and you taught me about the world outside. Because when I trembled on lonely nights, you never stopped holding my hand. Because when I felt lonely, you kissed me and said that I wasn&#39;t alone. You gave me so many things. That&#39;s why I love you. Because you gave me everything.</p>
